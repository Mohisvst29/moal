The main issue in this file is a missing closing brace and parenthesis in the section filter button's className template literal. Here\'s the fixed version of that section:

```javascript
{sections.map((section) => (
  <button
    key={section.id}
    onClick={() => setSelectedSectionFilter(section.id.toString())}
    className={\`px-4 py-2 rounded-lg transition-colors ${
      selectedSectionFilter === section.id.toString()
        ? 'bg-amber-500 text-white'
        : 'bg-white text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-100 border border-gray-300'
    }`}
  >
    {section.icon} {section.title} ({items.filter(item => item.section_id === section.id).length})
  </button>
))}
```

The line `section_id: selectedSectionFilter !== 'all' ? selectedSectionFilter : ''\` was also out of place and should be removed as it appears to be a stray line that doesn't belong in the template literal.

With these fixes, the code should now work properly. The rest of the file appears to be structurally sound with proper closing brackets and parentheses.
